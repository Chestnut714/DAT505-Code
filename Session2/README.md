# DAT505-Code
##session1


This session mainly modifies the material, shape and quantity of existing blocks. Material I choose is more obvious and distinctive. The number of specific cases is also a little less, more symmetrical. For shape, I changed the object from a square shape to a circular shape, a little like the marbles I played when I was a kid.
