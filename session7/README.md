The idea is to do a lot of different sizes, each refresh can change the position and speed of objects, I added to these objects are more colorful materials, a bit like a kaleidoscope played in childhood.
03's homework is a lot of eyeballs, eyeballs to see the place can change with the change of the mouse, and with refresh, the size and location of the eyeballs can change.
